            "Director James Cameron's \"Avatar\" movies are populated by a species of outsized blue beings resembling humans, except with tails. So why does our species lack a tail, considering that our evolutionary forerunners in the primate lineage had them?\n",
            "Scientists on Wednesday identified what might be the genetic mechanism behind the tailless condition of us and our ape ancestors - a mutation in a gene instrumental in embryonic development. The tail was a feature of most vertebrates for more than half a billion years, and its loss may have offered advantages as our ancestors moved from the trees to the ground, they said.\n",
            "The researchers compared the DNA of two groups of primates: monkeys, which have tails, and hominoids - humans and apes - which do not. They found a mutation in a gene called TBXT that was present in people and apes but absent in monkeys. To test the effects of this mutation, the researchers genetically modified laboratory mice to have this trait. These mice ended up with either a reduced tail or none at all.\n",
            "\"For the first time, we propose a plausible scenario for the genetic mechanism that led to the loss of the tail in our ancestors. It's surprising that such a big anatomical change can be caused by such a small genetic change,\" said New York University Langone Health geneticist and systems biologist Itai Yanai, who helped lead the study published in the journal Nature, opens new tab.\n",
            "The absence of a tail may have better balanced the body for orthograde - upright - locomotion and eventually bipedalism, said geneticist and systems biologist Bo Xia of Harvard University and the Broad Institute, the study's lead author.\n",
            "The mutation that led to tail loss, according to the researchers, occurred roughly 25 million years ago, when the first apes evolved from monkey ancestors. Our species, Homo sapiens, appeared roughly 300,000 years ago.\n",
            "The evolutionary lineage that led to apes and people split from the lineage that led to today's Old World monkeys, a family that includes baboons and macaques. Hominoids today include humans, the \"great apes\" - chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans - and the \"lesser apes\" - gibbons. The earliest-known hominoid, called Proconsul, was tailless.\n",
            "Hominoids evolved the formation of fewer tail vertebrae, losing an external tail. Vestiges of a tail remain in humans. A bone at the base of the spinal column called the coccyx, or tailbone, is formed from fused remnants of tail vertebrae.\n",
            "For many vertebrates, a tail has helped with functions like locomotion - think of propulsion by fish and whales - and defense - as with dinosaurs that wielded tails with clubs or spikes. Some monkeys and some other animals have prehensile tails that can grasp objects like tree limbs.\n",
            "\"A tail may be advantageous when you live in trees. As soon as you transition to land, though, it may be more of a liability,\" Yanai said.\n",
            "The advantages obtained by going tailless appear to have come with a cost. Because genes may contribute to multiple functions in the body, mutations that confer an advantage in one area may be detrimental in another.\n",
            "In this case, the modified mice showed a small increase in severe birth defects, called neural tube defects, of the spinal cord, resembling spina bifida in people.\n",
            "\"This suggests that the evolutionary pressure to lose the tail was so great that, despite creating the potential for this condition (neural tube defects), we still lost the tail,\" Yanai said.\n",
            "It is an interesting thought experiment to ponder whether humans could have evolved with tails. The Na'vi people of \"Avatar,\" alas, are science fiction.\n",
            "\"I'm a fan of James Cameron's 'Avatar' - it's just a beautiful world, and the Na'vi people use their tails for direct communication,\" Xia said. \"I hope to ask James why he created Na'vi people with tails.\"\n",

            "Since first appearing during the age of dinosaurs, snakes have authored an evolutionary success story - slithering into almost every habitat on Earth, from oceans to tree tops. New research details how these limbless reptiles that evolved from four-legged lizards got a figurative leg up on the competition.\n",
            "Scientists generated a comprehensive evolutionary tree of snakes and lizards aided by genomic data spanning roughly 1,000 species, while reviewing the fossil record and compiling data on snake diet, skull anatomy, reproductive biology and geographical range.\n",
            "They found that snakes experienced a burst of innovation early in their history and have evolved at a rate perhaps three to five times faster than their lizard cousins.\n",
            "\"It's like lizards are puttering along through time on the evolutionary moped or go-cart, and snakes are a V12 Lamborghini. Lizards are taking the city bus. Snakes are on the evolutionary bullet train,\" said University of Michigan evolutionary biologist Daniel Rabosky, senior author of the study published on Thursday in the journal Science, opens new tab.\n",
            "Snakes originated about 120 million years ago. Early snakes had vestigial limbs, with the oldest-known fully limbless snake living around 85 million years ago, according to George Washington University evolutionary biologist and study co-author R. Alexander Pyron.\n",
            "Early snakes changed their anatomy in important ways, mostly to become highly specialized predators, the study found. Their skulls became extremely flexible to better capture and swallow prey. They acquired an impressive prey-detection system, with their sense of smell, or chemoreception, becoming sophisticated. Some developed the ability to see infrared - essentially heat sensors. Some became venomous.\n",
            "The researchers compiled a large dataset on snake and lizard diets, including valuable information on the stomach contents of dead specimens from museum collections.\n",
            "\"Lizards generally eat insects, spiders, things like that. Sometimes plants. Snakes are really extreme dietary specialists and generally eat vertebrate animals or weird, hard-to-eat invertebrates. When snakes do eat invertebrates, they are often eating dangerous things like venomous centipedes and scorpions, or slimy, noxious snails or slugs,\" Rabosky said.\n",
            "Various groups of lizards over time have become limbless but never experienced the same evolutionary prosperity as snakes.\n",
            "\"Snakes are so different from other lizards that lack legs. Most such lizards burrow in the sand or soil, or maybe they crawl in grass. Snakes do everything from deep diving on coral reefs in the ocean to super-fast climbing in trees, and everything in between,\" Rabosky said.\n",
            "A burst of snake evolutionary innovation occurred around 90-110 million years ago, and again at various times after the asteroid strike 66 million years ago that doomed the dinosaurs, Pyron said.\n",
            "\"I have a feeling that because snakes were so good at innovating - at evolving new traits quickly - they were able to take advantage of ecological opportunities that came up, such as when the mass extinction 66 million years ago wiped out a lot of other species,\" Rabosky said.\n",
            "The smallest of the living snakes are threadsnakes, about 4 inches (10 cm) long. The longest is the reticulated python, around 20 feet (6 meters). The largest-known extinct snake was Titanoboa, at about 43 feet (13 meters).\n",
            "\"You might think that a snake is a snake is a snake. But arboreal snakes look completely different from aquatic snakes and burrowing species and so on,\" Stony Brook University evolutionary biologist and study lead author Pascal Title said.\n",
            "The ecological diversity of the 3,900 extant snake species is tremendous.\n",
            "Paddle-tailed sea snakes prey on fish eggs extracted from coral reef crevices. Some tree snakes have specialized jaws to extract snails from their shells, and use special chemicals to \"de-slime\" them. Some boas hunt bats roosting in caves. Some snakes specialize in eating frog eggs, earthworms or bird eggs. Some prey on other snakes.\n",
            "Some people fear and loathe snakes. Not these researchers.\n",
            "\"Everything about them is fascinating, from the way they move to the way they interact with the rest of their ecosystems,\" Pyron said. \"They are beautiful, graceful and mostly harmless.\"\n",

            "When a star up to 20 times the mass of our sun exploded in a nearby galaxy, the blast was so violent that it was visible to the naked eye from Earth's southern hemisphere for weeks in 1987. Scientists have finally identified the progeny of that supernova - an enormously dense object called a neutron star.\n",
            "Two instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that observed the supernova at infrared wavelengths spotted telltale chemical evidence involving argon and sulfur atoms indicating that a newborn neutron star is shrouded behind the debris left over from the blast, researchers said on Thursday.\n",
            "Such explosions can forge two different kinds of exotic compact objects: a black hole or a neutron star. The Webb observations solve the puzzle of which one resulted from this supernova.\n",
            "\"After having followed the supernova and searching for the compact object for more than three decades, it is exciting to finally find the missing evidence for the neutron star, thanks to JWST,\" said astrophysics professor Claes Fransson of Stockholm University in Sweden, lead author of the study published in the journal Science, opens new tab.\n",
            "\"Neutron stars are immensely dense compact remnants of the explosion of a massive star,\" said study co-author Patrick Kavanagh, an experimental physics department lecturer at Maynooth University in Ireland. \"It is comparable to compressing all the mass of the sun into the size of a city. They are so dense that a tablespoon of neutron star can weigh as much as a mountain.\"\n",
            "This supernova, called Supernova 1987A, occurred 160,000 light years from Earth in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a dwarf galaxy neighboring our Milky Way. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). The star, because of its large mass, had the relatively short life span of about 20 million years, much less than our sun's.\n",
            "The light from the explosion was seen from Earth on Feb. 24, 1987, the day after a burst of neutrinos - subatomic particles produced in vast quantities when a large star's core collapses - spawned by the supernova was detected. It marked the first time since 1604 that a supernova was visible to the naked eye.\n",
            "Stars at least eight to 10 times the sun's mass end their lives in a supernova, blasting much of their matter into space after the collapse of the stellar core but leaving behind a remnant. While catastrophic, these explosions are the main sources of chemical elements including carbon, oxygen, silicon and iron that make life possible.\n",
            "The remnant, depending on the doomed star's size, can be either a neutron star or black hole, an object whose gravitational pull is so strong not even light can escape.\n",
            "With Supernova 1987A, the star's size and the neutrino burst's duration had suggested the remnant would be a neutron star, but this had not been confirmed through direct evidence.\n",
            "\"Direct evidence for either one of these exotic objects has never been found so soon after a supernova explosion, until now,\" Kavanagh said.\n",
            "Webb's instruments detected argon and sulfur atoms whose outer electrons had been stripped off, meaning they were \"ionized.\" The researchers studied various scenarios and found that these atoms could have been left there in that condition only by ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from a neutron star.\n",
            "The researchers now are working to determine what variety of neutron star this is: a rapidly rotating type called a pulsar with a strong magnetic field or a more \"quiet\" one with a weak magnetic field.\n",
            "The findings represent another achievement by Webb, which became operational in 2022.\n",
            "Dust comprising more than 200,000 times Earth's mass formed as debris after the explosion, making the area around the resulting neutron star too opaque to be studied using telescopes focused on optical or ultraviolet wavelengths. But Webb focuses on the infrared.\n",

            "It is one of Earth's most haunting sounds - the \"singing\" of baleen whales like the humpback, heard over vast distances in the watery realm. Now scientists have finally figured out how these filter-feeding marine mammals do it.\n",
            "Baleen whales - a group that includes the blue whale, the largest animal in Earth's history - use a larynx, or voice box, anatomically modified to enable underwater vocalization, researchers said on Wednesday. They have evolved a novel structure - a cushion consisting of fat and muscle that sits inside the larynx, the researchers said.\n",
            "That means baleen whales make their sounds with their larynx, as do humans, while toothed whales - including dolphins, porpoises, killer whales and sperm whales - evolved a different mechanism employing a special organ in their nasal passages.\n",
            "It was recognized in the 1970s that baleen whales are very vocal, but precisely how they produce their array of sounds had remained unclear.\n",
            "\"These are among the most spectacular animals that have ever roamed our planet. They are highly intelligent, social animals that would have dwarfed most dinosaurs and feed on the smallest shrimp. They have the rare ability to learn new songs and spread their vocal culture across the planet,\" said University of Southern Denmark biologist Coen Elemans, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature, opens new tab.\n",
            "\"To communicate and find each other in murky and dark oceans, baleen whales depend critically on the production of sound. For example, humpback females and their calves communicate with each other by voice, and humpback males sing to attract females,\" Elemans added.\n",
            "All baleen whales, also including the fin, sei, right, gray, minke, bowhead and others, make very-low frequency calls barely audible to humans. A few species including the humpback and bowhead produce the higher-pitched sounds that people would be more familiar recognizing as whale songs.\n",
            "The researchers performed laboratory experiments using larynxes of dead sei, common minke and humpback whales stranded on beaches in Denmark and Scotland. They also developed a three-dimensional computer model of the whale larynx to simulate the effect of muscle contractions on sound.\n",
            "In humans, speech involves vocal folds of the larynx - the vocal cords. These little strips of vibrating tissue stretch across the airway, supported by small cartilage structures, called arytenoids, that rotate to open or close the larynx.\n",
            "In baleen whales, arytenoids are large and stiff, forming kind of a ring that can press against the laryngeal cushion. When the whale exhales, this cushion vibrates from the airflow in an undulating motion, generating the sounds.\n",
            "\"What is fascinating is that, although the laryngeal modifications are unique and a totally novel structure, the main source of sound - the physics underlying the interactions between air and tissue - follows the same principles as other mammals, ranging from bats to tigers to elephants, and including humans, along with birds,\" University of Vienna evolutionary biologist and study co-author W. Tecumseh Fitch said.\n",
            "\"It seems that all these living species have utilized the same set of tricks to make sounds, even though they use different organs or parts of organs to do so,\" Fitch added.\n",
            "The larynx evolved when the first land vertebrates started breathing air and needed to separate food from air to prevent choking. Whales evolved from land mammals roughly 50 million years ago. The larynx modification let baleen whales vocalize underwater, while protecting their airways.\n",
            "\"Returning to the sea posed serious challenges for the early whales and required adaptations for inhaling and exhaling massive volumes of air during explosive surface breathing, avoiding choking and drowning, and preserving air while vocalizing underwater,\" Elemans said.\n",
            "The study also showed that the whales' vocalizations fall within the same frequency range and ocean depths - down to about 330 feet (100 meters) - as human-made shipping noises, interfering with their ability to communicate.\n",
            "\"Regrettably,\" Elemans said, \"the baleen whales are physiologically constrained, and cannot easily sing higher or deeper to avoid human noise.\"\n",

            "On Feb. 20, 1824, English naturalist and theologian William Buckland addressed the Geological Society of London, describing an enormous jaw and limb bones unearthed in a slate quarry in the village of Stonesfield near Oxford.\n",
            "Buckland recognized that these fossils belonged to a huge bygone reptile, and gave it a formal scientific name: Megalosaurus, meaning \"great lizard.\" With that, the first dinosaur was officially recognized, though the actual word dinosaur would not be coined until the 1840s.\n",
            "\"It was the beginning of our fascination with dinosaurs,\" University of Edinburgh paleontologist Steve Brusatte said. \"His announcement opened the flood gates and started a fossil rush, and people went out looking for other giant bones in England and beyond.\"\n",
            "In the intervening 200 years, dinosaur science has flourished, providing insight into what these creatures looked like, how they lived, how they evolved and what doomed them. Dinosaurs trod the planet from about 231 million years ago to 66 million years ago during the Mesozoic Era. Their bird descendants remain with us today.\n",
            "\"Our understanding of dinosaurs has changed significantly since the 19th century,\" said paleontologist Emma Nicholls of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, home to the Megalosaurus fossils Buckland studied.\n",
            "\"Buckland and other gentlemen naturalists of the early 19th century would be stunned at how much we now know about dinosaurs,\" Brusatte added.\n",
            "Megalosaurus is a case in point. Buckland thought it was a lizard about 66 feet (20 meters) long, walked on four legs and could live on land or in the water. Scientists now know it was not quadrupedal and not a lizard, but belonged to the theropod group comprising meat-eating dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus  and Spinosaurus and was about 30 feet (9 meters) long.\n",
            "\"It scampered around on its hind legs, chasing down its prey, using its clawed hands and toothy jaws to subdue its victims,\" Brusatte said.\n",
            "Buckland, like others at the time, did not grasp how long ago dinosaurs lived, believing Earth to be only a few thousand years old. Scientists now know Earth is about 4.5 billion years old. Megalosaurus lived about 165 million years ago.\n",
            "\"It took several decades for geologists to understand that the Earth was truly old, and that life has evolved over vast stretches of time. Dinosaurs and the other fossils being discovered were a huge impetus in this bombshell change in people's understanding of their place in the world,\" Brusatte said.\n",
            "English naturalist Richard Owen recognized that fossils found in southern England of Megalosaurus and two other large land-dwelling reptiles, Iguanodon and Hylaeosaurus, formed a common group, calling them \"Dinosauria\" in an 1841 lecture and a publication the following year.\n",
            "The subsequent discovery of Hadrosaurus and Dryptosaurus fossils in the U.S. state of New Jersey showed that at least some dinosaurs were bipedal, changing the perception that they had resembled reptilian rhinoceroses. Beginning around the 1870s, the first complete large dinosaur skeletons - first in the American West, then in Belgium and elsewhere - demonstrated the distinctive anatomy and diversity of dinosaurs.\n",
            "In the 1960s, the identification of the smallish meat-eating dinosaur Deinonychus shook up dinosaur science, helping inaugurate a research period called the \"Dinosaur Renaissance.\" It showed that dinosaurs could be small and agile. Some were remarkably similar anatomically to early birds like Archaeopteryx, confirming how birds evolved from small, feathered dinosaurs. It also prompted a debate over whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded like birds, contradicting the long-standing conception of them as slow, lumbering and cold-blooded.\n",
            "\"In the decades following that, there was increasing work on dinosaur growth, on the use of CT scans, on analytical methods for reconstruction of evolutionary relationships and of biomechanical function, all helping to create a more dynamic and biological view of dinosaurs as living things,\" said University of Maryland paleontologist Thomas Holtz.\n",
            "Paleontologists put cranial fossils into CT scanners to build digital models of dinosaur brains and ears, gaining better knowledge of dino senses like sight, hearing and smelling. Researchers also now can tell the color of dinosaurs if their skin or feathers are sufficiently well preserved to retain microscopic melanosome bubbles holding pigment in cells.\n",
            "More than 2,000 dinosaur species are now known and paleontology is a vibrant, international science. Remarkable fossil finds are being made in places such as China, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and Mongolia.\n",
            "\"Regarding discoveries about dinosaurs in recent decades, the most important one to my mind is the discovery that at least meat-eating dinosaurs, theropods, had feathers rather than scales and that some had really well-developed feathers on their arms even though they were, for a variety of reasons, incapable of flight,\" said paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington.\n",
            "\"Presumably these feathers, which were often colorful, provided insulation for the body and, in at least some species, were used for display,\" Sues added.\n",
            "The extinction of the dinosaurs had long puzzled scientists, with various hypotheses offered, from the plausible to the ridiculous. Some even proposed that the shrew-sized mammals of the time ate up the dinosaur eggs.\n",
            "In 1980, researchers identified a layer of sediment dating precisely to the end of the dinosaur age containing high concentrations of iridium, an element common in meteorites, indicating a huge space rock had struck Earth. The Chicxulub crater at Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula - 112 miles (180 km) wide - subsequently was identified as the impact site of the asteroid that wiped out three-quarters of Earth's species, including the dinosaurs.\n",

            "\"Almost certainly yes,\" Holtz said. \"Mammals arose not long after the first dinosaurs, but spent many tens of millions of years in their shadows. Mesozoic mammals were highly successful and diverse, but only at smaller body sizes.\"\n",
            "\"The dinosaurs would have had to deal with the eventual drying and cooling of the world, and with it the reduction of the forests and their replacement with grasslands,\" Holtz added. \"But these changes seem to have been gradual enough that the dinosaurs would have had a chance to evolve adaptations to the new conditions, just as large mammals did.\"\n",
            "Scientists have evaluated the metabolism of dinosaurs using a formula based on body mass, as revealed by the bulk of their thigh bones, and growth rates, as shown by growth rings in fossil bones akin to those in trees.

            "Saturn's moon Mimas is known for its uncanny resemblance to the dreaded Death Star in the original \"Star Wars\" movie. But it has another intriguing distinction as well, according to researchers - a subsurface ocean hidden under its icy and crater-scarred outer shell.\n",
            "Astronomers said on Wednesday that data obtained by NASA's Cassini spacecraft on the rotational motion and orbit of Mimas confirm the presence of an ocean of liquid water beneath an ice layer 12-19 miles (20-30 km) thick. This ocean, they said, appears to have formed recently, in cosmic terms - less than 25 million years ago and likely between 5 and 15 million years ago.\n",
            "The findings make Mimas a compelling site for exploration into the conditions that could lead to the formation of life, considering Earth's first living organisms arose in our planet's primordial seas billions of years ago.\n",
            "\"At first glance, it is the most unlikely place in the solar system to look for liquid water,\" said Observatoire de Paris astronomer Valery Lainey, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature, opens new tab. \"It looks old and inactive - a huge amount of craters. Nothing betrays the ocean existence, at the moment.\"\n",
            "Mimas becomes the smallest of five moons in our solar system with compelling evidence of subsurface oceans, alongside Saturn's Enceladus and Titan, and Jupiter's Europa and Ganymede, Lainey said. There also are suspicions of subsurface oceans on a few other moons, including Jupiter's Callisto.\n",
            "Cassini finished 13 years of studying Saturn and its moons in 2017 with a death plunge into the huge ringed planet's atmosphere. Cassini's observations of the icy surface of Mimas did not spot any deformations suggestive of an ocean below. But the researchers determined that certain aspects of its orbit could be explained only by the presence of an internal ocean, not a solid interior.\n",
            "Mimas is the seventh-largest moon of Saturn, which all told has well over 100 moons ranging from Titan - larger than the planet Mercury - to some only the size of a city block.\n",
            "Mimas, not precisely round, has an average diameter of about 250 miles (400 km). It is tidally locked, meaning it perpetually shows the same side toward Saturn, as our moon does toward Earth. The most emblematic feature of Mimas is the Herschel crater, which stretches a third of the way across its face and makes it resemble the Death Star.\n",
            "Earth's moon is roughly 2,000 times more massive than Mimas.\n",
            "An internal ocean's presence implies a strong heat source inside Mimas that turned ice into an ocean. Mimas follows an elliptical orbit around Saturn at an average distance of about 115,000 miles (186,000 km). As its distance from Saturn changes along its orbit, the gravitational and tidal forces exerted by Saturn also change.\n",
            "\"This results in periodic deformation of Mimas' interior, and part of the energy involved in these deformations is converted into heat,\" said planetary scientist and study co-author Gabriel Tobie of the French scientific research agency CNRS and Nantes Universit√©.\n",
            "The liquid water inside Mimas represents more than half of this moon's total volume, though it amounts to just 1.2-1.4% the amount in Earth's oceans. The fact that the water is in contact with the rocky core of Mimas may facilitate the type of complex chemistry that could pave the way for life, they added.\n",
            "Scientists believe the basic ingredients for life - warmth, water and organic compounds - exist in the Saturnian system on Enceladus, which has huge plumes erupting off its surface. Even if Mimas also has these ingredients, the fact that its ocean is so young \"might be a challenge for life's development,\" Tobie said.\n",
            "\"However, nobody knows how long life needs to emerge from a suitable environment,\" Tobie added. \"Mimas may offer a unique opportunity to explore the first stage of life's development.\"\n",

            "Our sun and other stars form when a dense clump of interstellar gas and dust collapses under its own gravitational pull. Once a star is born at the center of such a cloud, leftover material forms a swirling disk around it that feeds stellar growth and often gives rise to planets.\n",
            "Newborn stars with these circumstellar disks had been observed by astronomers only in our Milky Way galaxy - until now. Researchers said on Wednesday they have spotted such a disk around a star larger and more luminous than the sun residing in one of our nearest neighboring galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud.\n",
            "The star, growing and accreting material from the surrounding disk, is about 10 to 20 times more massive than the sun and perhaps 10,000 times more luminous.\n",
            "As material is drawn by gravity toward a forming star, it flattens into a spinning disk. The newly observed disk has a diameter of about 12,000 times the distance of the Earth to the sun, or roughly 10 times larger than the one that encircled the sun when it formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago.\n",
            "The star, which also is unleashing a large jet of material into space, is around 160,000 light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n",
            "\"This is very exciting,\" said astronomer Anna McLeod of Durham University in England, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature, opens new tab.\n",
            "\"While we know of many stars like this one being formed in the Large Magellanic Cloud and other galaxies, we have never before observed a circumstellar accretions disk outside of the Milky Way, mainly due to lacking technology. Observing these disks in other galaxies is very important because it tells us about how stars form in environments different from that of the Milky Way,\" McLeod added.\n",
            "The detection was made using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Until now, circumstellar disks had been detected only within about 6,500 light years of Earth.\n",
            "The Large Magellanic Cloud is considered a satellite galaxy of the sprawling Milky Way, as is another galaxy called the Small Magellanic Cloud. Both are smaller than our galaxy and offer different galactic conditions. The Large Magellanic Cloud has less dust than the Milky Way and a smaller content of what astronomers call metallic elements - those other than hydrogen and helium.\n",
            "The researchers enjoyed an unobstructed view of the star.\n",
            "\"The star is visible at optical wavelengths, whereas all of the known stars in the Milky Way that are like this one - in terms of stellar mass and having an accretion disk - are hidden from optical telescopes because they are still very enshrouded by the gas and dust they are forming from,\" McLeod said.\n",
            "\"We suggest that the star being visible in the optical is due to the different properties of the galactic environment the star is in when compared to the Milky Way.\"\n",
            "Massive stars form more rapidly and have shorter lives than less massive stars like the sun.\n",
            "\"The formation of high-mass stars has been puzzling astronomers for decades, and so building a picture of how this happens under different physical conditions is both an important step and super exciting,\" said astronomer and study co-author Jonathan Henshaw of Liverpool John Moores University.\n",
            "The disk appears to be quite stable, not fragmenting as could happen with such structures.\n",

            "On the perilous Jurassic Period landscape of western North America, it was good to be big. Your life may have depended upon it.\n",
            "Paleontologists have conducted a study scrutinizing bite marks left by meat-eating dinosaurs on the bones of sauropods - the familiar plant-eating dinosaurs with long necks, long tails and four pillar-like legs that were the largest land animals around - about 150 million years ago. The examination offered insight into predator-prey dynamics during the dinosaur age.\n",
            "Of about 600 bones checked, bite marks - often deep grooves left in stout bone - were detected on 68 of them, spanning 40 individual sauropods and representing at least nine species.\n",
            "The nature of the bites led the researchers to an intriguing conclusion. These marks appear to have been made not by predators that had hunted and killed adult sauropods but rather through scavenging by meat-eaters that came across the bodies of sauropods already dead from causes like old age or infirmity.\n",
            "It simply may have been too risky, they said, for a predator - even one weighing multiple tons - to try to bring down an adult sauropod perhaps five to 10 times more massive like Brachiosaurus.\n",
            "\"While it must have happened occasionally, we can't find any wounds that would likely be the result of predation attempts,\" said paleontologist David Hone of Queen Mary University of London, who helped lead the study published this week in the journal PeerJ Life & Environment, opens new tab.\n",
            "\"The fact that we don't see things like healed bite marks from predation attempts in these adult sauropods does fit the idea that they were not usually targeted by predators. It would have happened to the old, sick, injured or other vulnerable animals. But in general, predators probably steered well clear of them,\" Hone added.\n",
            "Sauropods, the largest land animals in Earth's history, first appeared roughly 200 million years ago and lived until the end of the dinosaur age 66 million years ago.\n",
            "Meat-eating dinosaurs all were members of a group called theropods. And there were large ones prowling during the time examined in the study, including Allosaurus, Torvosaurus, Ceratosaurus and Saurophaganax. But they were dwarfed by adult sauropods reaching perhaps 50 tons.\n",
            "\"At that point, the prey has many more options for hurting the predator than vice versa. A single kick or tail swipe from a big sauropod could potentially be fatal. Most of the time, there would have been many more young sauropods around, so a theropod would have to have been suicidally determined to attack an adult,\" said study co-author Mathew Wedel, an anatomist and paleontologist at Western University of Health Sciences in California.\n",
            "The fossils in the study came from rocks called the Morrison Formation spanning 13 states in the western United States. Bites were detected on sauropod bones belonging to Camarasaurus, Galeamopus and Suuwassea as well as bones probably but not definitively belonging to Diplodocus, Apatosaurus and Brachiosaurus.\n",
            "The fact that theropods appear to have avoided hunting adult sauropods does not mean sauropods were not on the menu. The researchers noticed high levels of wear on fossilized teeth of theropods that did not correspond to the rarity of bites on adult sauropod bones.\n",
            "\"Dinosaurs were all egg-layers, and the largest sauropods were probably laying hundreds of eggs each year. So babies, juveniles and sub-adults always outnumbered the adults. We suspect that the big theropods were wearing down their teeth attacking, killing and completely consuming young sauropods, which wouldn't leave any bitten bones behind to be fossilized,\" Wedel said.\n",
            "\"If you're an Allosaurus, the vast majority of the sauropods you ever encounter will be young ones, and for the first few years of their lives they will be almost defenseless,\" Wedel added. \"So it's probably no surprise that we find such a diversity of big predators in the Morrison Formation. The sauropods were basically laying out a never-ending buffet for them.\"\n",

            "Dwarf planet Eris, similar in size to its better-known cosmic cousin Pluto, has remained an enigma since being discovered in 2005 lurking in the solar system's far reaches. While Pluto was explored by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft during a 2015 flyby, Eris - about 40% further from the sun - has never been visited.\n",
            "But scientists are gaining a fuller understanding of Eris and its differences with Pluto thanks to research that discerns details about this frigid remote world's internal structure and composition based on its orbital relationship with its moon Dysnomia.\n",
            "Eris, the researchers said on Wednesday, appears to have a rocky interior below a shell of ice. Pluto also has an icy exterior with rock below, but possesses a higher ice content and is thought to harbor an underground liquid ocean.\n",
            "\"We already knew that Eris is more rock-rich than Pluto, but what we didn't know was whether Eris had separated the rock from the ice,\" said University of California Santa Cruz planetary scientist Francis Nimmo, lead author of the study published in the journal Science Advances, opens new tab.\n",
            "\"That means that Eris got hot enough at some point in its history to melt, so that all the rock sank to the center. The ice is not motionless but is experiencing a slow churning motion, driven by leftover heat from the inside. Most likely there is no liquid ocean inside Eris,\" Nimmo added.\n",
            "Eris has a diameter of about 1,445 miles (2,326 km), slightly smaller than Pluto's 1,473 miles (2,370 km). By comparison, the diameter of Earth's moon is about 2,160 miles (3,475 km). Because of its greater concentration of rock, which is denser than ice, Eris has about 25% more mass than Pluto.\n",
            "\"As I like to think of it, take Pluto and add every single asteroid in the asteroid belt, and you get Eris. Pluto is puffed up by ice, while Eris is mostly rock with a little bit of ice on the outer side,\" said Caltech astronomer and study co-author Mike Brown, one of the three scientists who discovered Eris.\n",
            "Named after the ancient Greek goddess of discord, Eris orbits at an average of about 68 times further from the sun than Earth, taking 557 years to complete one orbit. Pluto orbits at an average of about 39 times Earth's distance from the sun.\n",
            "Dysnomia, named after the mythological daughter of Eris, is about 440 miles (700 km) in diameter and composed mostly of ice.\n",
            "\"Just like the Earth-moon system, tides on Eris slowly push Dysnomia away and slow down the spin of Eris. This process has gone to completion: Eris and Dysnomia always present the same face to the other,\" Nimmo said.\n",
            "Pluto has this same arrangement with its moon Charon, while the Earth-moon system differs.\n",
            "\"The moon always presents the same face to the Earth, but the Earth does not return the favor,\" Nimmo said.\n",
            "Standing on Eris, it would look like dusk at midday due to its great distance from the sun, which would appear like no more than a particularly bright star in the sky.\n",
            "\"On Eris, you could block out the sun with the head of a pin,\" Brown said.\n",

The International Astronomical Union, which sets definitions for planetary science, recognizes five dwarf planets - Ceres, Haumea and Makemake, in addition to Eris and Pluto - though dozens more may qualify. Eris is the most massive of them.\n",

            "Those waves traversed the cosmos and finally reached Earth last year. This gamma-ray burst, researchers said on Tuesday, caused a significant disturbance in Earth's ionosphere, a layer of the planet's upper atmosphere that contains electrically charged gases called plasma.\n",
            "Scientists previously determined that this was the strongest such burst ever detected.\n",
            "The ionosphere is situated about 30-600 miles (50-950 km) above Earth's surface, stretching to the very edge of space. It helps form the boundary between the vacuum of space and the lower atmosphere inhabited by people and Earth's other denizens.\n",
            "The gamma rays from the burst impacted Earth's atmosphere for a span of about 13 minutes on Oct. 9, 2022. They were detected by the European Space Agency's Integral (International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory) space observatory and various satellites orbiting close to Earth.\n",
            "The gamma rays caused a strong variation in the ionosphere's electric field, according to Mirko Piersanti, a space weather researcher at the University of L'Aquila in Italy and lead author of the research published in the journal Nature Communications, opens new tab.\n",
            "\"It was similar to what happens in general during a solar flare event,\" Piersanti said, referring to powerful bursts of energy from the sun.\n",
            "But the gamma-ray burst occurred a vast distance away - with the rays traveling about two billion light years - compared to the sun's relative closeness, showing how even faraway events can influence Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n",
            "Instruments on Earth showed that the gamma rays disturbed the ionosphere for several hours and even set off lightning detectors in India. The disturbance reached into the lowest layers of the ionosphere.\n",
            "Scientists since the 1960s have been measuring gamma-ray bursts - outpourings of energy released in supernovas or the merging of two neutron stars, which are the dense collapsed cores of massive stars. A burst as strong as the one detected last year would be expected to reach Earth about once every 10,000 years, according to scientists.\n",
            "The ionosphere, which helps protect life on Earth by absorbing harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun, is highly sensitive to changing magnetic and electrical conditions in space, usually connected to solar activity. It also expands and contracts in response to solar radiation.\n",
            "While this gamma-ray burst did not cause deleterious effects for life on Earth, it has been hypothesized that a strong one originating within the Milky Way and pointed right at us could pose a danger - including mass extinctions - by subjecting Earth's surface to a flood of harmful ultraviolet radiation.\n",
            "However, \"the probability that this happens is really negligible,\" said astronomer and study co-author Pietro Ubertini of the National Institute for Astrophysics in Italy.\n",
            "The effects of this gamma-ray burst were studied with the help of the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES), also called Zhangheng, a Chinese-Italian mission launched in 2018.\n",
            "\"Here we were lucky since we used the power of the EFD (electric field detector) instrument on board the CSES that is able to measure the electric field with unprecedented resolution,\" Piersanti said.\n",
            "Ubertini said the disturbance that occurred in the ionosphere was not seen by anyone on the ground.\n",
            "\"Nobody detected anything, but we don't know if it could have been possible to see some visible signal looking at the right time at the sky,\" Ubertini said.\n"
