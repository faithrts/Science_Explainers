Genetics, the microbiome, and low screening rates may be factors in the increase, experts say. Here are risk factors for the disease—and the most common symptoms.
Colorectal cancer is often thought to affect older people, but one in five cases diagnosed today occurs in people younger than age 55, compared to one in 10 cases in 1995, according to a recent study published by the American Cancer Society.
