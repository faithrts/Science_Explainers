The respiratory virus is a leading cause of childhood death worldwide. Experts weigh in on why cases are so high—and when new treatments and vaccines could be available.
Children’s hospitals across the United States are raising the alarm that their beds have filled up with young patients struggling to breathe. This year, the culprit is not coronavirus but respiratory syncytial virus—more commonly known as RSV.
RSV is not a new pathogen. The virus infects some 64 million people a year worldwide. But it poses a particularly high risk to adults over 65 and to children, who are more likely to require hospitalization. Globally, RSV causes about 160,000 deaths a year—including more than 100,000 children under the age of five. Still, there isn’t a vaccine for the disease or any treatments available for general use.
But solutions are on the way.
