# Science_Explainers

In this repo, I compile files related to my work with McGill's Office of Science Education (OSE) to make a database of science explainers.

## Summary
- science_explainer_database_creation.ipynb: the python notebook that creates the database
- txt_files: the .txt files of each article in the database
- article_urls.csv: the urls of each article in the database
- science_explainers_database.csv: resulting database of science explainers
